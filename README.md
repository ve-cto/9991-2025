# This is a template repository, ready for the 2025 Season! It will be updated as we go along with robot development.


* XBox controllers -> Any two ports on the Driver Station, the controller that is connected first controls functions of the robot, and the second controls driving.


To begin operation of the robot:
- Connect the XBox controller to the Driver Station
- Launch WPILib on the Driver Station 

- Turn on the robot by connecting a battery and pushing in the yellow switch on the Power Module
- When a light on the Wifi router turns orange,
  - Open the Driver Stations Wifi settings
  - Connect to the network labeled '9991' (#TEAMMAME#)
    
- Press the elipse (...) in the top-right corner of WPILib, and select "Deploy Robot Code" from the dropdown menu.
  > If the Deployment fails, either
  > - Turn the robot off and on
  > - Press the RESET button on the RoboRIO and reflash the code

- Open the FRC Driver Control Panel, and FIRST Dashboard Module
  - Select "Teleoperated" from the scroll menu
  - When ready, click "Enabled"
  > If during operation you lose control, with the Driver Station reporting "Emergency Stop", you need to reboot and reconnect to the robot.

  - To practice using automatic timings, go to the configuration window of the Driver Control Panel, and change the Practice timings to your liking. Then head back to the main menu and enable Practice.
